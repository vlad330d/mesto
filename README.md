2nd Project: Place

In this project, I strengthened knowledge of using HTML and CSS, made this site responsive for different screen sizes, and also learned how to work with JavaScript to make the site more interactive and intuitive for the user.

(upcoming updates, make a WEBpack of this project and conect it to API)
